# MCMC-2d-charges
This repo contains code to run Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulations of charges in pseudo-2d dielectric confinement.

File Descriptions:
simulate.c: contains code for running the script and executing the MCMC algorithm
energies.c: contains functions for energy calculations and various helper functions
gaussian.c: contains funtion to generate gaussian random numbers with mean 0 and standard deviation 1
